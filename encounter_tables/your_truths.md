### I want to play in a low fantasy world with only humans and animals

Change the [foe type probabilities](foe_type_probabilities.csv) table and set that foe type to 0.

### I think there should be more humans in the Havens

Change the [foe type probabilities](foe_type_probabilities.csv) table.

### I want to see more/fewer enemies of a certain rank in a certain region

Change the [foe_rank_probabilities](foe_rank_probabilities.csv) table.

### I want to change the foes that appear in a particular region

Change the relevant \*\_foes.csv table for that region. Take care that easy enemies should appear higher and within ranks/types, common enemies appear higher. Enemies that appear lower in the tables are treated as less likely.
