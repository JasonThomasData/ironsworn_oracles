## Methodology

- I read the Ironsworn manual and made a note of where each creature lives.

- For each region, made a note of which foes/animals/beasts etc lived there

- Categorised each foe according to its type [Ironlander,Firstborn,Animal,Beast,Horror]

- Ordered all of the foes in each region's table according to their rank

- Defined these probability tables:

    - [Foe rank probabilities](foe_rank_probabilities.md)

    - [Foe type probabilities](foe_type_probabilities.md)

- Used Rscript and lpSolveAPI to solve the optimimum probability for encountering each foe.
