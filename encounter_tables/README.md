## Ironsworn oracle for random encounters

This is software to generate random encounter tables for the RPG game, Ironsworn.

- Each region in the game has a table with NPCs/foes that are appropriate for that region.
- The tables scale in difficulty depending on location. Havens have more probabibility for Troublesome and Dangerous foes, but it gets harder in the northern regions.
- The tables scale to meet the character's experience. A player with no experience will never encounter the laviathon. A character with 20 experience has a low chance to encounter a Troublesome foe
- Tables can be generated using your truths. For example, you might only ant to have a world with animals and humans. See [your truths](your_truths.md) for more on this.

To understand how the tables were compiled, see [methodology](methodology.md)

To install the software and generate your own tables, see [using_script](using_script.md)

Some foes don't appear in certain places, to keep the tables from being cluttered. See [notes](notes.md) for more on this.
