## Ironsworn oracle for random encounters

- Each region has a table with NPCs/foes that are appropriate for that region
- The tables scale difficulty depending on location. Havens have more probabibility for Troublesome and Dangerous foes, but it gets harder in the northern regions.
- The tables scale to meet the character's experience. A player with no experience will never encounter the laviathon. A character with 20 experience has a low chance to encounter a Troublesome foe

See [methodology](methodology.md)

Roll d100 and add your total experience. If you roll out of table range, roll again.
